# ENG1-Pirate-Game

## Description

You are a privateer with allegiance to one College at the University of York. You sail the great Lake of
York on quests and adventures, and may choose to attack ships of other Colleges, try to sack
Colleges, etc. Gameplay ends when the player is defeated in some way (e.g., in combat with
another privateer, or destroyed by a rival College), or when the player has achieved the gameâ€™s
objective.

## How to Install and Run the Project
Java 11 is a requirement for this game to run. Later versions may work, but it is not guaranteed. <br />
To run the game, either:
- Launch the jar file as normal,
- Download and run one of the launch scripts alongside the jar file (.sh for Linux / .bat for Windows),
- To play in fullscreen, download one of the scripts ending with -fs and run alongside the jar file. <br />
Please note that this game was designed for 1280x720 gameplay so playing in fullscreen may have bugs.
